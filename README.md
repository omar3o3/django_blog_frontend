Welcome to the front end portion of Rambler.

The tech stack for the front end of Rambler includes react, material ui, axios, 
react-router-dom, and jwt-decode.

The purpose of this projec was to create a social media site inspired by famous sites such as Twitter and Reddit.

For the back end portion of Rambler, I used Django / Django Rest Framework, and this is my first project
using Python. The tech stack for my backend also includes beautifulsoup4, django-cors-headers, djangorestframework-simplejwt, 
lxml, and selenium.

For the database I used PostgreSQL.
